# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
  Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.
  Company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 


## General Information
   You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
   When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
         1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
         2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
   Given Data contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, 
   which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Solution Approach
   I have decided to use EDA to understand how customer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default. There are 6 steps involved in this EDA.

   1. Data Sourcing
   2. Data Cleaning
   3. Data Transformation
   4. Derived Metrics
   5. Univariate / Segmented Univariate Analysis
   6. Bivariate Analysis
